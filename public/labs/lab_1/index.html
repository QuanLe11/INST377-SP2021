    <h3>Lists</h3>
    <p>Let's make an unordered list.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The tutorial readings for this week were very helpful and straightforward.</li>
        <li>I had fun typing all of this and understanding what I typed.</li>
        <li>I couldn't figure out how to type a spanish accent for an album I had in mind for my top 5.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And now, one in order. I don't really have a top 5 albums list, so here are 5 albums a really like.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>4eva Is A Mighty Long Time by Big K.R.I.T.</li>
        <li>Bandana by Freddie Gibbs</li>
        <li>Malibu by Anderson .Paak</li>
        <li>Late Registration by Kanye West</li>
        <li>Sweet Insomnia by Gallant</li>
    </ol>
 
    <h4>Inline Elements</h4>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention</em> to something in a line of text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize</strong> something in the text.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Sometimes you want to do both.</strong></em></p>
 
    <h5>Empty Elements</h5>
    <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br/>
    Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>
 
    <hr/>
 
    <p>This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.</p>
